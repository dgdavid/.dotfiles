# dotfiles

My custom collection of dotfiles. Second attempt :sweat_smile:, now managed via
[GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

## vim

So far I was using the awesome Steve Francia's vim distribution,
[spf13-vim](http://vim.spf13.com/). A couple of months ago I switched to a less
sophisticated configuration using [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus).
But now I am giving a try to
[space-vim](https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim) :grin: :grin:
